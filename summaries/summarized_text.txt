## CHSW LAB WORK - Smart Parking Project: Summary

This document outlines a smart parking project being undertaken by Group 11 in the CHSW lab.  The project identifies common parking challenges and proposes technology-driven solutions.

**1. Problem Statement:**

Traditional parking systems face the following issues:

*   **Limited Parking & Increased Vehicles:** Too many cars, not enough spaces.
*   **Consequences:**  This leads to wasted time, fuel wastage, traffic congestion, and driver frustration as people search for parking.
*   **Manual Processes:** Manual vehicle checks by security personnel cause further delays and inefficiencies.
*   **Profitability Issues:** Ineffective pricing and inefficient space utilization result in low profitability for parking services.

**2. Relevant Research (Note: Dates are in the future, suggesting a theoretical proposal):**

The project draws inspiration from the following (hypothetical) research papers:

*   **Paper 1: "Enabling Smart Parking for Smart Cities Using Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning"** - Focuses on utilizing IoT and Machine Learning to create smart, efficient parking systems.
*   **Paper 2: "Two-Stage Efficient Parking Space Detection Method Based on Deep Learning and Computer Vision"** - Concentrates on using Deep Learning and Computer Vision to accurately detect available parking spaces.

**3. Proposed Improvements:**

Group 11 proposes the following solutions to address the identified problems:

*   **ML-Based Pricing Model (Dynamic Pricing):** Implement a dynamic pricing system driven by Machine Learning that adjusts prices based on real-time demand, time of day, and space availability to maximize revenue and manage demand.
*   **Three-Dimensional Stakeholder Model:**  Design the system to optimize benefits for all stakeholders involved: drivers (ease of parking), parking staff (efficient operations), and service owners (increased profitability).
*   **Enhanced Vacant Space Detection:**  Employ advanced computer vision techniques to significantly improve the accuracy of detecting available parking spaces.
*   **Improper Parking Alerts:**  Develop a system to automatically detect and notify about vehicles parked incorrectly (e.g., across lines, in restricted areas) to ensure compliance and maximize space utilization.

**In essence, Group 11 aims to create a smart parking system that is efficient, profitable, and beneficial to all parties involved by using machine learning, computer vision, and a stakeholder-centric design approach.** The proposal is forward-thinking, leveraging future technologies to solve current parking problems.

## Dynamic Pricing Model Explained

This document describes a simplified dynamic pricing model. It illustrates how various factors influence the price of a product or service, with the ultimate goal of maximizing profit.

**What is a Pricing Model?**

A pricing model is a structured system or set of rules used to calculate the price of a product or service. It moves away from static pricing and incorporates real-time conditions and data.

**Key Components (Factors):**

This specific model considers the following factors when determining price:

*   **Weather:** Pricing adjusts based on weather conditions.
    *   *Example:* Higher ride-sharing prices during rainstorms due to increased demand and fewer available drivers.
*   **Time and Date:** Pricing varies based on time of day, day of the week, or specific dates (holidays, events).
    *   *Example:* "Happy Hour" discounts, weekend surcharges, or increased hotel rates during holidays.
*   **Road Traffic Density:** Pricing adjusts based on traffic congestion.
    *   *Example:* Ride-sharing services using surge pricing during rush hour.
*   **Price (Current):** The existing price influences future price adjustments.
    *   *Example:* Gradual price increases to avoid alienating customers, or avoiding large price swings based on past adjustments. The current selling price informs the next price adjustment.
*   **Profit:** The model aims to maximize profit by finding the optimal balance between price and sales volume.
    *   *Example:* The model adjusts prices to achieve a desired profit margin based on all other factors.

**Categories of Factors:**

*   **External Conditions:** Weather, Time/Date, Road Traffic Density. These are generally outside the control of the business.
*   **Internal Data:** Current Price, and ideally, historical Profit data. The business can track and leverage these factors.

**How it Works:**

The model dynamically adjusts prices based on these factors to optimize profit.

*   *Example:* A ride-sharing service increases prices during rush hour on a rainy day because demand is high. The model considers the current price and past profit margins, then adjusts the price to capitalize on the demand without deterring customers.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices change based on real-time conditions.
*   **Profit Optimization:** The primary goal is maximizing profit.
*   **Simplified Model:** Real-world models are often much more complex.
*   **Data-Driven:** Effective dynamic pricing requires accurate data collection and analysis.
*   **Algorithm-Based:**  Typically implemented using algorithms that automatically adjust prices.

**In conclusion, this model outlines a dynamic pricing strategy designed to maximize profit by considering a variety of internal and external factors and adjusting prices accordingly.**
